## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) defines the requirements for Spark, an autonomous agent system that transforms natural language requests into executable multi-step workflows for software development tasks.

### 1.2 Scope
Spark provides:
- Natural language to workflow conversion
- Autonomous multi-step task execution
- LLM-powered planning and orchestration
- Extensible tool ecosystem for development tasks
- Safe execution environment with security controls

### 1.3 Definitions and Acronyms
- **Agent**: Autonomous software component capable of planning and executing tasks
- **Workflow**: Sequence of interdependent steps to accomplish a goal
- **Tool**: Executable component that performs specific operations (file system, shell, etc.)
- **LLM**: Large Language Model (Claude, GPT)
- **Orchestrator**: Main coordination component for workflow execution

---

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Spark transforms traditional development workflows from manual multi-step processes to autonomous execution based on natural language requests.

**Traditional Approach:**
```bash
mkdir project && cd project
npm init -y
npm install express
echo "console.log('Hello');" > index.js
npm install --save-dev jest
# ... many more manual steps
```

**Spark Approach:**
```bash
spark agent "Create a Node.js project with Express server and Jest testing"
```

### 2.2 Product Functions
1. **Natural Language Processing**: Convert user requests to structured workflows
2. **Workflow Planning**: LLM-powered task decomposition and dependency analysis
3. **Autonomous Execution**: Execute workflows with error handling and retry logic
4. **Tool Management**: Extensible registry of development tools
5. **Safety Controls**: Validation, sandboxing, and security measures

### 2.3 User Classes
- **Developers**: Primary users executing development workflows
- **DevOps Engineers**: Using for infrastructure and deployment automation
- **Tool Developers**: Creating custom tools for specific domains
