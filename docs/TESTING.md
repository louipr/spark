# Test Plan
## Spark - Autonomous Agent System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Status:** Active

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the testing strategy, standards, and procedures for the Spark autonomous agent system to ensure high quality, maintainable, and performant software delivery.

### 1.2 Scope
This test plan covers:
- Unit testing of business logic components
- Integration testing of system interactions
- Performance testing and optimization
- Test automation and CI/CD integration

---

## 2. Test Scope

### 2.1 In Scope
- Core agent workflow orchestration
- LLM provider integrations
- Tool execution and validation
- Security and safety controls
- Performance and reliability

### 2.2 Out of Scope
- Third-party LLM service testing
- Operating system functionality
- External CLI tool behavior

---

## 3. Test Types and Levels

### 3.1 Unit Tests
- **Location**: `tests/unit/`
- **Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Coverage**: Business logic, data transformation, error handling
- **Dependencies**: Mocked external services
- **Performance Target**: < 5 seconds execution time

### 3.2 Integration Tests  
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`
- **Purpose**: Test component interactions and external integrations
- **Coverage**: API integrations, workflow orchestration, tool execution
- **Dependencies**: Real external services when available, graceful fallbacks
- **Performance Target**: < 15 seconds execution time

### 3.3 End-to-End Tests
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/` (future)
- **Purpose**: Full workflow validation
- **Coverage**: Complete user journeys
- **Dependencies**: Full system deployment

---

## 4. Test Environment

### 4.1 Tools and Frameworks
- **Test Runner**: Jest
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Mocking**: Jest mocks for external dependencies
- **Coverage**: Built-in Jest coverage reporting

### 4.2 Environment Setup
- Node.js 18+ required
- TypeScript compilation before test execution
- Environment variables for API keys (optional for unit tests)

---

## 5. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 5.1 Entry Criteria
- Code compilation successful
- All dependencies installed
- Test environment configured

### 5.2 Exit Criteria
- All tests pass (100% pass rate)
- Code coverage meets minimum thresholds
- Performance targets met (< 20 seconds full suite)
- No critical security vulnerabilities

---

## 6. Test Standards and Best Practices

### 6.1 Test Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each test validates one specific behavior
- **Independence**: Tests can run in any order without dependencies
- **Repeatability**: Consistent results across multiple executions
- **Fast Feedback**: Optimize for development workflow speed

### 6.2 Naming Conventions
- Test files: `*.test.ts`
- Test descriptions: Behavior-driven (should/when/then)
- Mock objects: `mock*` prefix

### 6.3 Performance Standards
- **Unit Test Suite**: < 5 seconds
- **Integration Tests**: < 15 seconds  
- **Full Test Suite**: < 20 seconds
- **Individual Tests**: < 2 seconds

---

## 7. Quality Assurance

### 7.1 Code Coverage
- **Minimum**: 80% line coverage
- **Target**: 90% line coverage
- **Focus**: Business logic and error handling paths

### 7.2 Test Maintenance
- Regular performance monitoring with `npm test --verbose`
- Quarterly review of test value and relevance
- Immediate updates when business logic changes
- Continuous refactoring to maintain quality

### 7.3 Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Testing mock behavior instead of business logic
- Extensive timeout testing unless core functionality
- Duplicate test coverage without added value
- Testing framework code rather than application code

---

## 8. Test Deliverables

### 8.1 Test Artifacts  
- Test source code in `tests/` directory
- Test execution reports (console output)
- Coverage reports (generated on demand)
- Performance benchmarks (tracked in CHANGELOG.md)

### 8.2 Documentation
- This test plan document
- Test case documentation within test files
- Performance optimization guidelines (this document)
